# üìà Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis with Python

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) dataset for India across different sectors (Rural, Urban, Rural+Urban). It reveals inflation trends, sectoral growth, seasonal impacts, and COVID-era fluctuations.

## üí° Key Findings

-Overall Inflation Trend: There has been a steady increase in the CPI over the past decade, with inflation particularly rising after 2020.

-Minimal Seasonal Effect: The seasonal decomposition shows minimal seasonal fluctuations, indicating that CPI trends are mainly driven by long-term factors.

-Rural vs. Urban Impact: Inflation levels are consistent across rural, urban, and combined sectors, suggesting uniform price changes in these regions.

-Sectoral Correlations: High correlations are observed between sectors like housing, transport, and miscellaneous, indicating their significant impact on overall inflation, while categories like eggs 
 and vegetables show more independent price movements.

-Sector-Specific Trends: Fuel and light have experienced the steepest price increase, especially post-2020, while health and housing show steady inflation growth. Cereals and products display more 
 volatility.

-COVID-19 Impact (2020-2021): During the pandemic, fuel prices initially dropped due to lower demand, then surged in 2021. Health and housing sectors saw consistent price increases, reflecting 
 inflationary pressures on essential services during this period.
